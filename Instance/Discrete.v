(** This is the discrete category. A category is said to be discrete when every
  * morphism is an identity. Every type [A] is the type of objects of a discrete
  * category (just add one identity morphism [x ~> x] for each [x : A]), and every
  * discrete category is so determined by its set of objects. *)
